## His Story
Kaiser was adopted in the Fall of 2022, but before we met, he probably went through some shit.
He's a great dog.
You can't be great without enduring some shit.

The earliest information known was him being impounded in Dickinson, ND and shortly after scheduled for euthanasia.
In August 2022 he was surrendered and placed in the Jamestown, ND Humane Society shelter.
He found his way into Adam's home and heart on October 10, 2022.

Since being a part of Adam's life, Kaiser has found joy tugging on ropes, going for long runs, and chewing through toys and pillows until they
are in bits and pieces.
When Adam is away from home, Kaiser has been able to enjoy the company of his uncle Thomas, his grandpa Mike, or grandma Angie to babysit him.
Kaiser has made quite a few close friends, such as Scarlett, Loki, Henry, Rosie, Kodak, and Thor.

A favorite activity for Kaiser is to get dressed up for the holidays/seasons, particularily he looks good in his work coat or a charming bandana.
